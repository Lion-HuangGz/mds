    "* Extract twitter data using tweepy and learn how to handle it using pandas.\n",
    "* Do some basic statistics and visualizations with numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.\n",
    "* Do sentiment analysis of extracted (any user's) tweets using textblob.\n",

    "The requirements that we'll need to install are:\n",

    "* NumPy: This is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.\n",
    "* Pandas: This is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n",
    "* Tweepy: This is an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.\n",
    "* Matplotlib: This is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.\n",
    "* Seaborn: This is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n",
    "* Textblob: This is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
