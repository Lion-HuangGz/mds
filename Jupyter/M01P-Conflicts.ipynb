    "In distributed databases, where copies of data might be stored in more than one location, natural network and system characteristics might mean that changes made to a document stored in one location cannot instantly update or replicate to other parts of the database.\n",

    "IBM Cloudant for IBM Cloud tries to help you avoid conflicts by warning you of potential problems. It does this by returning a [409 response](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/api/http.html#http-status-codes) to a problematic update request. However, a 409 response might not be received if the database update is requested on a system that is not currently connected to the network. For example, the database might be on a mobile device that is temporarily disconnected from the Internet, making it impossible at that moment to check if other potentially conflicting updates have been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you request a document that is in a conflict situation, IBM Cloudant returns the document as expected. However, the version returned is determined by an internal algorithm that considers a number of factors; you should not assume that the returned document is always the most recent version, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not check for conflicts, or fail to address them, your IBM Cloudant database begins to exhibit several behaviors:\n",
    "* Increasing inconsistencies in document content, because there are more and more conflicting documents.\n",
    "* Increasing database size, because all conflicting documents must be retained until the conflict is resolved.\n",
