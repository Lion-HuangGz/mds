    "Apiori Algorithm is a Association Rule learning Algorithm and is used to find frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. By frequent itemsets we should think of items who are frequently associated with each other within the whole dataset. In order for a frequent itemset to be valid the subsets of the itemset needs to be frequent by themselves, this is called anti-monotonicity or downward-closure poperty. The anti-monotonicity guarantees a efficient search, this is necessary because the algorithm goes through all combinations adding one at a time. The process of adding one at a time is called buttom up approach.\n",

    "Before we train our apriori algorithm on the dataset, let's import the apyori.py library which contains the classes we will be using. We will declare a variable called rules since the apriori algorithm takes the transactions list as input and outputs association rules. If we inspect our Apiori function we see it accepts one main argument and that is an iterable object our transactions list. We can also specify the support, confidence and lift thresholds. A new argument which we have not discussed yet is min_lenght, it specify's the minimum length of our rules, we will set this to 2 to prevent rules with only one item.\n",

    "\n",
    "The minimum confidence should prevent that rules are made based on the wrong reasons, there are products who are bought frequently together not because they're strongly associated but because they are frequently bought products independent of each other. We want our rules to be relevant, choosing 0.8 is to high and will give us no results on this dataset, 0.4 will give us irrelevant rules as described earlier, the winner is 0.2 because this confidence minimum gave us relevant rules that were proven true enough times but not too frequent to be irrelevant to our goal. This minimum is found by running the Apriori algorithm different times and checking if the results makes sense. \n",

    "The lift measurement is a good indication of the relevance of our rules, we will set our minimum lift to 3 because we can be sure that these rules will be significant. Remember that these arguments depends on your dataset or problem. The Apriori is an experimental algorithm, we need to try different threshold and see if the produced rules have the wanted effect in the real world if not than we have to tune our thresholds some more."
